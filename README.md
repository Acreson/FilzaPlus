FilzaPlus allows custom themes and more languages to be added to it. In the `layout/Library/Application Support/FilzaPlus/` folder, you'll find a `Themes` and a `Languages` folder. Themes are plists that define hex color codes, and languages are plists that define regex expressions. Feel free to create your own theme or add a new language and submit a pull request.
